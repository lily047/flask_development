## Jinja2 Template Rendering & Data Grouping

This module demonstrates server-side data handling and dynamic template rendering using Flask and Jinja2.  
Structured input data is grouped into student and course entities, and templates are rendered conditionally based on command-line input. Course data is additionally visualized using charts to illustrate variations.

Concepts covered:
- Jinja2 template rendering
- Data grouping and structuring on the server side
- Conditional rendering logic
- Backend-to-template data flow
